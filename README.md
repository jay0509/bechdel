### Watch This Instead

### [https://shannonvturner.com/bechdel](https://shannonvturner.com/bechdel)

Uses the Bechdel Test API to figure out whether your movie passes the Bechdel Test and Imdb Ratings to suggest a better movie if it doesn't.

**What's the Bechdel Test?**

It's a test of women's representation in film. There are three criteria:
1. There must be at least two women in the film;
2. Who talk to one another;
3. About something other than a man.

Watch This Instead has rating info for over 6000 movies. When you search for new movies, they get added to the database.

The Bechdel Test API is user-driven.  If you'd like to contribute so that the API (and my site) has more movies, go to [http://bechdeltest.com/add/](http://bechdeltest.com/add/) (note: I am not affiliated with bechdeltest.com, but their API is at the core of this project)

This project uses the [Bechdel Test API](http://bechdeltest.com/) and the [Open Movie Database API](https://www.omdbapi.com/)

### It's also a Twitter Bot!

### [@BechdelBot](https://twitter.com/bechdelbot)

Just @-mention @bechdelbot with the name of your film and the bot will reply with whether it passed or failed the Bechdel test!
